A a simple single page web application build with javascript and php.

Basically the app connects to a DB and retreives a list of students.
User is allowed to add, edit or delete students. When a student is clicked
a new table is generated which contains that student's marks and subjects.
When the name of the subject is clicked another table appears that contains
the names of all students that have any mark in this subject.

As this was for class assignment, my work is router.php file from server-side
and index.html, client.js and client-render.js from client-side.
All other files were given to us ready to be used.
