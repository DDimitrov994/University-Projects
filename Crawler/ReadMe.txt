This is a web crawler, written as browser extension.

Please keep in mind that this is not a finished product, but as it's
in my opinion, my most interesting work, I am uploading it. 

It has the following functionality:
1. Scrape the specified content (via Xpath) from the web page, loaded
in the current tab in the browser.
2. Write the information in a database.
3. Let the user run his own queries on the database.
